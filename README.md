# Word Guessing Game
Very simple word guessing game created in Python with the Turtle Graphics Module . Requires two players to play. Code leaves a lot to be desired ( quite a bit of spaghetti code) but it was one of my first projects.

# How to run
Simply run the word-guessing-game.py file

# How to play
The game requires 2 players to play. The game uses two screens, a command line terminal for input and a turtle graphics window for the second player to guess. The first player enters the word to be guessed at the start of the game and the second player has to guess the word and entered the word letter by letter. Player 2 has a total of 8 attempts to guess the word. If they guess the wrong letters 8 times, they fail the game. There's some drawing and animation on the turtle screen to give the game some more appeal, without being just a bare-bones terminal game.
